Control Two Stepper Motors using serial inputs to arduino 
you can send serial data using any method like ( i2c , uart , or via serial monitor on arduino ide ) 

#HOW TO TEST
1. Upload sketch to your arduino , 

2. Attach 2 28byj-48 5V Stepper Motors by The pin configuration in the code .. 

3. open serial monitor on your arduino IDE

4. send steps like (  StepsForMotor1:StepsForMotor2 )

5. Multiple orders  ( StepsForMotor1:StepsForMotor2&StepsForMotor1:StepsForMotor2 )
